Day 1
I guess I should start this off by saying hello to you (the reader or my future self). So hello, my name is 006b009 or Six-bee-nine as my friends call me. I was an inmate at the national prison of the Northern Federation Colonies up until yesterday when I escaped. I have started writing this journal so that I can remember what happens each day due do certain side effects of removing my neck restraint. I am told once removed it destroys your memories every 23.68 hours. I was also told that I had a hand in designing it which would be ironic I guess. Anyway before I forget, Julie (the dark-haired girl with silver eyes) is the reason I broke out, well was broken out. I or so I’ve been told need to help her stop something which I also had a hand in creating (I’m beginning to realize why they locked me away to begin with). So I (you) need to find her. All I know is that she is in the PLACE HOLDER valley located somewhere in the middle of the fighting. I am going to talk to her tomorrow I guess so look forward to that (my future self). It’s been 23 hours or so since I broke out so in the interest of time I’ll give you the main points: Talk to Julie; Trust people with tattoos of a hawk in the shape of a diamond, but no one else; Write in this journal again so your future self will see it and remember.  That should be all you (I) need.
