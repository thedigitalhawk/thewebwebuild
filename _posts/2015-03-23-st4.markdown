Reflection
It was four years ago, the day everything changed. I am one of them now; there is no turning back, not after what I have done. I still remember when I could see her every day. I had no idea who she was or her part in all this. At first, I thought some evil force was controlling her, but I came to find that she has more to with this than even she knows. To have your very mind turned against you, what a horrible way to live. That is why I have chosen this path. To set her free, and all those blinded by this infected world in which we live. The things I will do and have done have all been for her.
