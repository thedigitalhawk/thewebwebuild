Perspective

Log #2288

I can't even tell what year it is anymore. And I certainly can't tell the month or day. All  I know is that it feels like years since I started walking. Whenever it was I decided to leave the small settlement I was living in it was a long time ago. I wish I could say I left by choice but, then again that would never happen. I liked the settlement in fact I loved it there, or I should say loved someone there. Her name was Aoa. She was the mayor's servent. This made her off limits. I decided that she was worth any risk. I had no idea the punishment would be exile.
