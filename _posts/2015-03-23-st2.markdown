// ST_EP_01 "SHADOWS" //
The shadows of the surrounding buildings made it difficult to navigate though the already dark steets of the abondoned city. Barrd and his team were completly un-aware that they were already surrounded by enemy forces. They walked the abondoned streets searching for those who had already found them. 
"No sign of them sir!" Katie shouted with a slight shutter in her voice.
"Keep it down" Barrd wispered over the radio.
They stopped at the entrance to the train station. Only feet away from the way back home. Suddenly Barrd saw a bright light, then a noise so loud he covered his ears in pain. He closed his eyes. What seemed like hours went by before he opened them again. What he saw was nothing short of pure horor. He team was scattered everywhere, their lifeless bodies lay in what remained of the train station. As he stood there unable to move from the fear he heard some one screaming "RUN!"
"RUN! Barrd"
He could tell from her voice it was Katie. It sounded like it was behind him. As he started to turn to find the source of the screams he felt a cold sharp pain in  his back. He fell as the small shread of light faded. With his last breath he tried to say the words he had wanted to for so long. He opened his mouth as his face fell into the dirt.
