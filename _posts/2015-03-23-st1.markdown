The field lay before me; I could feel the warmth of the sun’s rays as they touched my face. She was there, I reached out to grab her hand, but it faded. 
-Adam…
-Adam!...
-Adam!, wake up!
Yeah, yeah I’m on it.
-Have a nice nap?
Something like that…, we should move on.
-Yeah I know, while you were napping the rest of our team moved ahead.
Well some of us don’t have time to get their “beauty” sleep in.
-Hey you never know if your gunna meet some nice ladies.
Something tells me “nice” ladies aren’t quite what you have in mind.
-Well, you know, but enough talk we should really get moving or boss will have our heads.
Yeah, you aren’t the one she has it out for.
-Yeah I guess your right.
