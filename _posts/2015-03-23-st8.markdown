Figure-Head Part 1 
She sat in a chair with her eyes glued to her notebook.
She didn't move an inch, as I stepped heavily towards her.
For most people this level of concentration is abnormal, but for her this was the everyday norm.
"Sera, don't you ever move from your chair?”
--Really? She didn't even flinch. Guess it’s time for something more attention grabbing. I wonder what would get her attention? Maybe if I shake her chair? Wait, my water bottle! She can’t ignore this.
"Surprise!"
"Isaac!" she said as she looked up at me. "What on earth was that for?” she said while moving the wet hair from her face.
"Hey don't get all mad, it's your fault for not looking up when I said something"
--She looks pretty mad though maybe I went to far? Nah.
"I was working on something" with the attitude of a young girl who didn't get her way, she yelled.
"Well obviously, but the boss needs to see you"
--I don't know why he needs to see her.
"About what?"
--If only she showed this much interest in me.
"Something about a loose one in Figurehead"
--That’s something I'm glad to have nothing to do with.
"Tell him I'll be right there" "After I dry off" she uttered under her breath.
