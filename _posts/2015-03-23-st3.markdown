Dust filled the air as Lieutenant Havid walked slowly towards the check-point.
"Good morning sir" One of the gaurds said to him as he grabbed his id badge and directed it in their general direction.
Havid walked past the guard ignoring his attempt at small talk. Havid knew this wasn't a good morning. He had recieved a report several days ago that 13 enemy combatants had inviltrated and stolen national secrets. 11 were confirmed killed at the scene two were missing and no stolen property was recovered. That wasn't what annoyed him the most however, it was the fact that his boss pulled him out here in the middle of no where. Havid was in his late 50's and wasn't the quickest anymore, but his experience and intuition made him one of the nations top investigative agents. 
Havid walked at a slower pace than most people. His co-workers offen refered to him as the ice man, because of his relaxed movements and his quiet nature. 
"You, get over here" Havid said to one of the support investigators.
"Y-Yes sir" A small woman replied.
"Ma'am can you please show me the pictures that were taken by the first responders?" Havid said impatiently.
"Yes sir, I can go ask for those"
"Ma'am, Scarlet is it, you should be able to pull them up on your data pad"
"Oh, right" She said getting quieter as she reflected on her imcompetance"
