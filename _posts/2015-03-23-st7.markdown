It all started ten years ago, March 16, 2012. I used to think that there was something I could have done, some way that I could have changed how things ended up. I was wrong. They had this planned from the very start. I am sure you are confused by these words, wondering what I am talking about. Like I said it was ten years ago. I had just gotten home from my job at Interon Computer Industries. I walked in the door kissed my wife and hugged my daughter. The night was normal; we ate dinner, watched TV, took showers, and brushed our teeth. Just like every other monotonous day. It was not until I woke up in the morning that it became apparent to me something was very wrong. I awoke to the sound of my wife screaming as men in full police swat armor busted into my bedroom.
