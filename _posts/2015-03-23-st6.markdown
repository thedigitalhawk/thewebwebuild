The snow falls faster and faster, im not sure how long ive stood here looking down at the valley. Just yesterday we had gone through our normal routine. We had gone to work, gone to school, when shopping. Now everthing is gone. Most of our friends and family are gone. Each one taken from us before their time. At first we were dumbfounded by these events then furious, now devoid of everything but our sorrow. Some have already laid down in the snow to freeze to death, their feet weighted down by the pain. I was a police officer fresh from the academy now I'm this crowds forced leader. I know they need my help but I can't look away. She was down there when it happened. I can't just leave her behind.


Samuel Clark, a police officer never would have guessed that his first day out of the academy would turn out like this. Everything he once knew is now gone. Something terrible has happened leaving most of the people in the worlds largest city dead or wounded. Forced to lead a small group of souviors in their search for food and shelter. He is torn between leading these people and searching for the woman he loved. Which path will he choose?
