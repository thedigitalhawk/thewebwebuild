Figure-Head Part 2 

I’m glad I don’t have her job.
I have no idea what I would do if my memory had to be uploaded and downloaded all the time.
Well I can say she is braver than me.
I should get back to work and stop thinking about this, but I can’t. I wish she never got promoted, the way she looks now it’s like something is missing.
I can’t think like this I need to get back to work before I get in trouble.
Now where’s my pen? I’m sure I left it here.
“What is that noise?”
Where are they all running?
Rejected the transfer, what does that mean?
I wonder where they’re going.
It looks like they’re headed towards the conference room, Sera’s in there!
I have to go see if she’s ok.
Oh no. Why is Sera shaking.
“Do something!”
“What’s wrong? Help her!”
“She will be fine” a cold voice said.
“Who are you?”
“Edward Jones, I am the head doctor on this station.”
Head doctor, maybe he can tell me what is going on.
“What is happening to her, and when will I be able to see her?”
“Come with me Isaac”
How does he know my name? Wait that doesn’t matter I need to see her.
“Right through here”
It’s dark.
“Hey where are you going?”
“I’ll see you soon” he grinned.
Really what is… what is this pain?
It hurts.
My head, it hurts.
I feel numb.
Am I dying?
